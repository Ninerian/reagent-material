# Reagent Material

An example project of combining Material UI and ClojureScript Reagent.

## To run

* git clone the project
* cd reagent-material

```
lein repl
(run)
```

After a while, assets should have been minified and ClojureScript compiled.

Follow its instructions to build a new version, then copy the built JavaScript and CSS files into the reagent-material project.
